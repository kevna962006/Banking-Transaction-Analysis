# Banking-Transaction-Analysis
🏦 Bank System SQL Project
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a basic banking database system using MySQL. It manages customer information and transaction records and demonstrates various SQL operations such as filtering, sorting, aggregation, joins, window functions, and subqueries.

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate core SQL concepts used in real-world database systems.

🗄️ Database Setup
Create Database
CREATE DATABASE bank_system;
USE bank_system;

This database stores all tables related to the banking system.

📋 Tables Used
1️⃣ Customers Table

Stores basic information about bank customers.

Column	         Description
cus_id	      Unique customer ID (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
name	        Customer name
email	        Customer email
city	        Customer city
acc_type	    Account type (Savings / Current)
acc_bal	      Current account balance

Purpose:

Maintains customer account details.
2️⃣ Transactions Table

Stores financial transactions performed by customers.

Column	   Description
tra_id	  Unique transaction ID
cus_id	  Customer ID (Foreign Key referencing customers table)
amount	  Transaction amount
tra_type	Type of transaction (credit / debit)
tra_mode	Mode of transaction (UPI, ATM, NEFT, IMPS)
tra_date	Date and time of transaction

Purpose:

Records deposits, withdrawals, and other transaction activities.
📥 Sample Data

Sample data is inserted into both tables to simulate real banking operations.

Customers belong to cities such as:

Hyderabad
Delhi
Mumbai
Chennai
Bangalore

Transactions are performed using modes like:

UPI
ATM
NEFT
IMPS
🔍 SQL Queries Explanation
1. View All Customers
SELECT * FROM customers;

Displays all customer records stored in the database.

2. View All Transactions
SELECT * FROM transactions;

Displays all transaction records in the system.

3. Customers With Balance Greater Than 1500
SELECT cus_id, name FROM customers WHERE acc_bal > 1500;

Retrieves customers whose account balance is greater than 1500.

4. Sort Transactions by Date
SELECT * FROM transactions ORDER BY tra_date DESC;

Displays transactions sorted from latest to oldest.

5. Show Unique Transaction Modes
SELECT DISTINCT tra_mode FROM transactions;

Lists different transaction methods used in the system.

Example results:

UPI
ATM
NEFT
IMPS
6. Top 5 Transactions by Amount
SELECT * FROM transactions ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 5;

Retrieves the five largest transactions in the database.

7. Customers Whose Name Starts With 'A'
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

Filters customers whose names begin with the letter A.

Example:

Alice
Anjali
Arjun
8. Total Transaction Amount Per Customer
SELECT cus_id, SUM(amount) FROM transactions GROUP BY cus_id;

Calculates the total transaction amount for each customer.

9. Customers With Total Transactions Greater Than 2000
SELECT cus_id, SUM(amount)
FROM transactions
GROUP BY cus_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 2000;

Shows customers whose total transaction amount exceeds 2000.

Note: HAVING is used because the condition is applied after aggregation.

10. Join Customers and Transactions
SELECT c.name, t.amount, t.tra_type
FROM customers c
JOIN transactions t ON c.cus_id = t.cus_id;

Combines customer details with transaction records.

Displays:

Customer name
Transaction amount
Transaction type
11. Running Total of Transactions
SELECT cus_id, amount,
SUM(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY cus_id ORDER BY tra_date) AS running_total
FROM transactions;

Calculates a running total of transactions for each customer using window functions.

Concept used:

Window Functions
12. Rank Customers by Account Balance
SELECT name, acc_bal,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY acc_bal DESC) AS rank_no
FROM customers;

Ranks customers based on their account balance from highest to lowest.

Concept used:

Window ranking function (DENSE_RANK)
13. Customers With Above-Average Transactions
SELECT cus_id
FROM transactions
GROUP BY cus_id
HAVING AVG(amount) >
      (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM transactions);

Finds customers whose average transaction amount is higher than the overall average transaction amount.

Concepts used:

Subqueries
Aggregation
🧠 SQL Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the practical usage of:

Database Creation
Table Creation
Primary Keys
Foreign Keys
Data Insertion
Filtering (WHERE)
Sorting (ORDER BY)
Unique Values (DISTINCT)
Aggregation (SUM, AVG)
Grouping (GROUP BY)
Filtering Aggregated Data (HAVING)
Table Joins
Window Functions
Ranking Functions
Subqueries
✅ Conclusion

This project simulates a basic banking system database and demonstrates how SQL can be used to:

Manage customer records
Track transaction activities
Perform financial analysis
Generate useful insights from banking data

It provides a strong foundation for understanding SQL database design and query optimization.
